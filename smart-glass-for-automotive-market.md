<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Glass for Automotive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrochromic</li><li>SPD</li><li>PDLC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Smart glass in the automotive market includes three main types: electrochromic, suspended particle device (SPD), and polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC). Electrochromic glass can change its tint in response to electrical stimulation, providing adjustable privacy and glare reduction. SPD offers dynamic tinting by aligning suspended particles in a liquid when electrified, allowing for quick transitions from transparent to opaque. PDLC, on the other hand, utilizes liquid crystals to achieve similar effects, switching from clear to opaque when an electric current is applied, enhancing both comfort and aesthetics in vehicles.</p></p>
