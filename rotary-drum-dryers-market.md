<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Drum Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Directly Heated</li><li>Indirectly Heated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary drum dryers are essential in various industries for moisture removal. The market is segmented into directly heated and indirectly heated types. Directly heated dryers use a flame or hot air to dry materials directly, ensuring rapid drying but with potential for product contamination. Indirectly heated dryers, on the other hand, utilize heat transfer through the drum's walls, preventing direct contact between the drying medium and material, making them suitable for heat-sensitive products and reducing contamination risks.</p></p>
