<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Heart Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transcatheter Heart Valves</li><li>Tissue Heart Valves</li><li>Mechanical Heart Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial heart valve market comprises three main types: Transcatheter Heart Valves, Tissue Heart Valves, and Mechanical Heart Valves. Transcatheter Heart Valves are minimally invasive devices delivered via catheters, allowing for quicker recovery. Tissue Heart Valves, made from biological tissues, offer a natural function and reduced blood clot risk but may require replacement over time. Mechanical Heart Valves, constructed from durable materials, provide long-lasting solutions but necessitate lifelong anticoagulation therapy due to a higher risk of blood clots.</p></p>
